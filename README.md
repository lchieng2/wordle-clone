# Wordle Clone

Wordle is a popular word game where players guess a five letter word by guessing other five letter words and receiving hints based on their letters. It grew in popularity in 2021 and is currently owned by The New York Times.

This project tested my ability to design and re-create this game using skills in front-end development.

Created using React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
